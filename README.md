# RWD Starter-Kit

This is just a simple website starter kit I created for my team at CEDR Systems to help out with the workflow of starting a new website project. It is also for best practice with developing a healthy medium between us designers and programmers as multiple people have their hands on any one project at a time.

Version 1.0
This version of my RWD Starter Kit includes the following:
* Bootstrap 3
* Node Package Manager
* GulpJS
